Under the guidance of Columbia Records executive and later husband Tommy Mottola, Carey continued booking success with followup albums Emotions (1991), Music Box (1993), and Merry Christmas (1994), and was established as Columbia's highest-selling act. Daydream (1995) made music history when its second single \"One Sweet Day\", a duet with Boyz II Men, spent a record sixteen weeks on top of the Billboard Hot 100, and remains the longest-running number-one song in U.S. chart history. During the recording of the album, Carey began to deviate from her R&B and pop beginnings and slowly traversed into hip hop. This musical change became evident with the release of Butterfly (1997), at which time Carey had separated from Mottola.\nCarey left Columbia in 2000, and signed a $100 million recording contract with Virgin Records America. Before the release of her film Glitter (2001), she suffered a physical and emotional breakdown and was hospitalized for severe exhaustion.

She signed a multimillion dollar contract deal with Island Records in 2002, and after an unsuccessful period, returned to the top of music charts with The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). Its second single \"We Belong Together\" became her most successful single of the 2000s, and was later named \"Song of the Decade\" by Billboard. Carey once again ventured into film with a well-received supporting role in Precious (2009); she was awarded the \"Breakthrough Performance Award\" at the Palm Springs International Film Festival, and received Black Reel and NAACP Image Award nominations.\nThroughout her career, Carey has sold more than 200 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time.

In 2012, Carey was ranked second on VH1's list of the \"100 Greatest Women in Music\".

He previously served for four months as Prime Minister from 2002 to 2003, and concurrently served as both Deputy Prime Minister and as Foreign Minister between 2003 and 2007. He is currently a member of the Advisory Panel for the President of the Islamic Development Bank.\nAdvocating staunch Islamist political views during his university years, Gül became a Member of Parliament for Kayseri in 1991 and was re-elected in 1995, 1999, 2002 and 2007. Initially a member of the Islamist Welfare Party, Gül joined the Virtue Party in 1998 after the latter was banned for anti-secular activities. When the party split into hardline Islamist and modernist factions in 2000, Gül joined fellow party member Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in advocating the need for reform and moderation. He ran against serving leader Recai Kutan for the Virtue Party leadership on behalf of Erdoğan, who was banned from holding political office at the time. As the candidate for the modernist camp, he came second with 521 votes while Kutan won 633. He co-founded the moderate Justice and Development Party (AKP) with Erdoğan in 2001 after the Virtue Party was shut down in the same year, while hardline conservative members founded the Felicity Party instead.\nGül became Prime Minister after the AKP won a landslide victory in the 2002 general election, since Erdoğan was still banned from office. His government had removed Erdoğan's political ban by March 2003, after which Erdoğan became an MP for Siirt in a by-election and took over as Prime Minister. Gül subsequently served as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Deputy Prime Minister until 2007. His subsequent bid for the Presidency drew strong and highly vocal opposition from ardent supporters of secularism in Turkey and was initially blocked by the Constitutional Court due to concerns over his Islamist political background. He was eventually elected Turkey's first Islamist President after the 2007 snap general election.\nAs President, Gül has come under criticism for giving assent to controversial laws which have been regarded by the political opposition as unconstitutional. In June 2013, he signed a bill restricting alcohol consumption into law despite initially indicating a possible veto, which was seen as a contributing factor to sparking the 2013–14 anti-government protests.

He is the first Turkish president to assume office through direct elections, as mandated by the constitutional referendum in 2007.\nFrom 1994 to 1998, Erdoğan served as Mayor of İstanbul, and from 2003 to 2014 he served as the 36th Prime Minister of Turkey. He founded the Justice and Development Party (AKP) in 2001, leading it to three general election victories in 2002, 2007 and 2011, before stepping down as party leader upon his election as President in 2014. Ideologically claiming to be a moderate Islamist, his administration has overseen liberal economic and socially conservative policies.\nErdoğan was a semi-professional footballer, playing for Kasımpaşa between 1969 and 1982, before being elected Mayor of İstanbul from the Islamist Welfare Party in 1994. In 1998, he was banned from office and sentenced to prison for 10 months after reciting a religiously discriminatory poem in Siirt. In 2001, he founded the conservative AKP, winning the 2002 general election with nearly two-thirds of the seats in parliament. Abdullah Gül became Prime Minister of the first single-party government since 1987. Erdoğan became Prime Minister in March 2003 after his political ban was annulled.\nAs Prime Minister, Erdoğan is known for his negotiations for Turkey’s accession to the European Union, an economic recovery following a financial crash in 2001, an allegedly Neo-Ottoman foreign policy, a peace process with the PKK, and two successful referendums on constitutional reform in 2007 and 2010. Projects such as Marmaray and two high-speed train networks were completed as part of Erdoğan’s 2023 vision for the centenary of the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923. With support from exiled cleric Fethullah Gülen's Cemaat Movement, Erdoğan was able to curb the political power of the pro-secular military through the controversial Ergenekon and Sledgehammer court cases.\nIn contrast, child poverty rose to 63.5%, and Turkey suffered the highest number of workers' deaths in Europe, with 301 miners killed in Soma in 2014. Nationwide protests broke out against Erdoğan’s rule in 2013 and 2014. An internationally criticised crackdown on protestors by the police and AKP youth members led to 22 deaths, resulting in Gülen withdrawing support from the AKP and EU ascension talks stalling. A ₺100 billion government corruption scandal in 2013 led to arrests of Erdoğan's close allies, with Erdoğan calling the subsequent investigation a coup attempt led by a 'parallel structure' formed from Gülen's supporters. His government responded with controversial reforms to the judiciary and security forces. Turkey blocked Twitter and YouTube after Erdoğan was incriminated in a recording released on the Internet. Although the judiciary annulled the ban, Erdoğan’s government came under continued fire for media censorship, electoral fraud, the illegal construction of the world's largest palace on protected forest land, and disregard for the constitution and the rule of law. His critics and political opposition have branded him a dictator while some media outlets named him authoritarian.\nErdogan was named as the AKP candidate for the 2014 presidential election on 1 July, which he won with 51.79% of the vote. He was sworn in as the 12th President of Turkey on 28 August, with speculation that he would continue to pursue his political agenda while his new Prime Minister, Ahmet Davutoğlu, would take a docile approach."}},{"fullname":"Virat Kohli ","twitter":{"handle":"@imVkohli","twitter_id":"71201743","followers_count":6196986},"wikipedia":{"extract":"Virat Kohli ( pronunciation ) (born 5 November 1988) is an Indian cricketer.

He was ordained a Catholic priest in 1969 and from 1973 to 1979 was Argentina's Provincial superior of the Society of Jesus. He became the Archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1998 and was created a cardinal in 2001 by Pope John Paul II.\nFollowing the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI on 28 February 2013, a papal conclave elected Bergoglio as his successor on 13 March. He chose Francis as his papal name in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi. Francis is the first Jesuit pope, the first from the Americas, the first from the Southern Hemisphere and the first non-European pope since the Syrian Gregory III in 741, 1,272 years earlier.\n\nThroughout his public life, both as an individual and as a religious leader, Pope Francis has been noted for his humility, his concern for the poor and his commitment to dialogue as a way to build bridges between people of all backgrounds, beliefs and faiths. He is known for having a simpler and less formal approach to the papacy, most notably by choosing to reside in the Domus Sanctae Marthae guesthouse rather than the papal apartments of the Apostolic Palace used by his predecessors. In addition, due to both his Jesuit and Ignatian aesthetic, he is known for favoring simpler vestments void of ornamentation, including refusing the traditional papal mozzetta cape upon his election, choosing silver instead of gold for his piscatory ring, and keeping the same pectoral cross he had when he was cardinal. Francis has said that gay people should not be marginalized but maintained the Church's teaching against homosexual acts; as a cardinal, he opposed same-sex marriage in Argentina and elsewhere. In addition, he maintains that he is a \"son of the Church\" regarding loyalty to Church doctrine, has spoken against abortion as \"horrific\", and suggested that women be valued, but not clericalized. He has stated that Catholics, namely politicians, who support abortion and euthanasia are ineligible for communion. Summarily Pope Francis reiterates that \"It is absurd to say you follow Jesus Christ but reject the Church.\"\nAccordingly, he urged Bishop Charles J. Scicluna of Malta to speak out against adoption by same-sex couples, maintained that Catholics who remarry following divorce may not receive the Eucharist, and excommunicated a former Catholic priest for Eucharistic sacrilege and heretical views. He emphasized the Christian obligation to assist the poor and the needy, and promoted peace negotiations and interfaith dialogue.

In 1992, Armstrong began his career as a professional cyclist with the Motorola team. He had notable success between 1993 and 1996, including the World Championship in 1993, Clásica de San Sebastián in 95, Tour DuPont in 95 and 96, and a handful of stage victories in Europe, including stage 18 of the 1995 Tour de France. In 1996, he was diagnosed with a potentially fatal metastatic testicular cancer. After his recovery, he founded the Lance Armstrong Foundation (now the Livestrong Foundation) to assist other cancer survivors.\nBy January 1998, Armstrong had renewed serious cycling training, having signed a new racing contract with US Postal. He was a member of the US Postal/Discovery team between 1998 and 2005, in which he won his Tour de France titles, as well as a bronze medal in the 2000 Summer Olympics.

In 2012, a USADA investigation concluded that Armstrong had used performance-enhancing drugs over the course of his career and described it as being \"the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen.\" As a result, Armstrong received a lifetime ban from competing in all sports which follow the World Anti-Doping Agency code, as well as being stripped of his seven Tour de France titles. On October 22, 2012, the Union Cycliste Internationale upheld USADA's decision. It also decided that his stripped wins would not be allocated to other riders.

His six-year term began in 2012. He is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and served as governor of the State of Mexico from 2005 to 2011. Peña Nieto was declared president-elect after the 2012 general election was declared valid by the Federal Electoral Tribunal, amidst accusations of electoral fraud. He took office on 1 December 2012, succeeding Felipe Calderón as president.\nPeña Nieto announced his presidential candidacy in September 2011, four days after leaving office as governor. He formally registered in November 2011. Peña Nieto garnered 38% of the votes and does not hold a legislative majority. His election marked the return of the PRI after a twelve-year hiatus. The PRI had governed Mexico uninterrupted for 71 years until it was defeated by the National Action Party (PAN) in 2000.\nThe return of the PRI was not welcomed by everyone. Marches against Peña Nieto drew tens of thousands of people across Mexico, particularly from the Yo Soy 132 student movement, who protested supposed voting irregularities and alleged media bias. Others protested that during its time in power, the PRI became a symbol of corruption, repression, economic mismanagement and electoral fraud. Many Mexicans and urban dwellers worried that its return to power might signify a return to Mexico's past. Peña Nieto promised that his government would be much more democratic, modern and open to criticism. He also pledged to continue the fight against organized crime and drug trade and that there would be no pacts with criminals.\nThe rule of the PAN was marked by an inability to pass reform and the party lacked a congressional majority. The PRI touted that it \"knows how to govern\", an argument compelling enough for many voters to support the party. Throughout the election Peña Nieto maintained a wide lead in the polls. Peña Nieto proposed that he would reinvigorate Mexico's economy, permit the national oil company, Pemex, to compete in the private sector, and reduce drug violence that has left more than 55,000 dead in six years.

In 2005, at age 18, Kesha was signed to producer Dr. Luke's record label, Kemosabe Entertainment, and publishing company. Although an active musician since then, singing background vocals and writing songs for other artists, her breakthrough came in early 2009 after appearing on rapper Flo Rida's number-one single, \"Right Round\", although she was uncredited. Her debut album, Animal, and her first extended play, Cannibal, were released in 2010. Kesha's music and image propelled her to immediate commercial success, with Animal debuting as the number-one album in the United States. She also achieved two number-one singles, \"Tik Tok\" and \"We R Who We R\", and a string of top ten hits from the album and its re-release. At the same time, she continued to write songs for other artists, including \"Till the World Ends\" for Britney Spears.
